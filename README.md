# Hey, I'm Mat 👋

### Biofouling Manager · CTO · Developer

Marine scientist turned software engineer.<br/>
I build tools that bridge the gap between operational reality and digital efficiency.

By day, I manage biofouling operations for Franmarine and lead tech at **MarineStream**.<br/>
By night, I'm automating something that shouldn't take as long as it does.
